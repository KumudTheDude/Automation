Once you launch the code you get to choose how many clicks you want to record Enter that number of clips and then perform the tasks you want to set it on  Repeat
Once you are done recording the task you set up your desktop in a way that the clicks would replicate For example, having a fixed setup of windows set at designated places 
You can replay and cheque the sequence of the clips A good practise would be Reset your desktop the way it was when you started clicking 
It is better to practise the cliques and memorise the exact pl and try to get the task done in the least number of clicks and on repeated basis

**working Things** 

1. #Right Click Works
2. #Left Click Works
3. #Text Writing Works
4. #Replaying Works
5. #Loading and Replaying Works

**#Issues to be fixed**

1.)Special Commands (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V,Enter,Esc) All hsese dont work
2.) Delay Between Clicks Is reversed, 25 Is fast and .5 is slower, 1-3 is good
3.) A delay of 25 will create a complete gap for a long then restart the next loop (There is a lot of unnecessary idle time)
4.) Maybe one of these lines
5.) click_delay_entry = tk.Entry(root, bg='white', fg='black')
6.) click_delay_entry.grid(row=1, column=1, padx=10, pady=10)
7.) click_delay_entry.insert(0, "1")

8.)Sometimes when loaded it clicks at different coordinates, maybe its not saving coordinates correctly
9.)Scroll Doesn't work
